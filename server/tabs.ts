/**
 * tabs — choose what an instance offers.
 *
 * LearningHarness offers Chat, Terminal, Search and Settings, plus optional
 * plugin tabs. Terminal opens a shell as the server's user; when exposing the
 * app beyond the local machine it must be possible to disable that tab.
 *
 * `PI_WEB_TABS=chat,search,settings` is that way. Absent — the default —
 * means every tab, so nothing changes for anybody who does not set it.
 *
 * The rule that shapes the whole thing: **a hidden tab whose messages the
 * server still accepts is a hidden tab, not a disabled one.** Anything that
 * can open the WebSocket can send `terminal_create`. So the client stops
 * drawing them and the server stops answering them, and the second half is the
 * one that matters.
 *
 * Chat is never off: it is the application.
